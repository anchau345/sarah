	**Note:** The `cd` command is used to change the current working directory, and it does not have many options like **other commands.** However, it can be used with various arguments to navigate through directories.

```bash
cd --help
man cd
```


**RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE PATH**
* Path means a position in the directory tree.
* To express a path, you can use relative path or absolute path.
* In relative path expression, the path is not defined uniquely, **depends on your current path**.
* In absolute path expression, the path is defined uniquely, **does not depend on your current** path

**Absolute Path**
* Begin with a forward slash
* Complete "road map" to file location
* Can be used anytime you wish to specify a file name

```bash
cd ../subdir - change to subdir in parent directory
cd ~user - change to another users home directory
cd ~/Documents - change to Documents directory in home
```

**Relative Path**
* Do not begin with a slash
* Specify location relative to your current working directory
* Can be used as a shorter way to specify a file name

```bash
cd /path/to/dir - change to absolute path directory
cd /home/kali/Desktop
cd /etc
```

**Examples:**

- `cd ~` - change to home directory

- `cd ..` - change to parent directory

- `cd /` - change to root directory

- `cd -` - change to previous directory

- `cd .` - change to current directory

- `cd ~/Documents` - change to Documents directory in home

- `cd ../subdir` - change to subdir in parent directory

**OBJECTIVES**
* Understand Linux users and group
* Manage users and groups
* Modify file permissions and ownership
****
**USERS**
Users are entities that interact with with the system directly or indirectly, they are identified by a unique username and user ID (UID) with associated permissions, group memberships and resources.

**TYPES OF USERS**
* **Root User**: This is a super user with unlimited privileges and access to all system resources. username = root
* **System Users**: Created by the system for specific purposes such as:
	* **Daemon users** e.g. http, ftp  which can be use to run system services and daemons
	* **System Service users**: Users that manage system services e.g. MySQL
* **Regular Users**: account created for individual people or applications with limited privilege's and access to system resources.
* **Group users**: Members of a group sharing common permissions and access to resources

**USERS CHARACTERISTICS**
* username - Unique identifier for each user
* user ID (UID) - Numeric identifier for each user
* Group ID (GID) - Numeric identifier for each user's primary group
* Home directory - Default directory for each user
* Password - account password
* Shell - user's interactive terminal shell

**USER COMMANDS**

```bash
useradd - create a new user
usermod - Modify an existing user
userdel - Delete an existing user
```

**GROUPS**
A group is a collection of users who share common permissions, access rights, and resources. It  helps manage user permissions and access control.
* Group name - Unique identifier for the group
* Group ID (GID) - Numeric identifier for the group
* Members - users who belong to the group
* Permissions - Access rights and priviledges assigned to the group

**TYPES OF GROUP**
* Primary group - A user's default group, assigned when the user is created 
* Secondary group - Additional groups a user belongs to , providing extra permissions

**BENFIT OF GROUPS**
* Simplified user management
* Efficient permission management
* Improve access control

**GROUP COMMANDS**

```bash
groupadd - create a new group
groupmod - Modify an existing groups
groupdel - delete a group
```
 
**FILE PERMISSIONS**
Permissions determine what action a user, group members or other users can perform on a file or directory.

**TYPES OF PERMISSION**
* Read (r) - view the contents of a file
* Write (w) - Modify or delete a file, create new files in a directory
* Execute (x) - Run a file as a program or script or script in a directory

**CATEGORIES OF USERS THAT CAN HAVE PERMISSION**
* Owner (u) - The user who created the file or directory
* Group (g) - Members of the group
* Other (o) - All other users on the system

![[Pasted image 20240725152345.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240725152552.png]]

**PERMISSION NOTATION**

**USING `find`** **COMMAND**
The find command is a powerful tool in Linux and Unix-like operating systems that allows you to search for files and directories based on various criteria such as name, type, user etc.

**SYNOPSIS**
`find path options expression`

**Components:**
* **Path:** The directory path where the search starts. If omitted, the current directory is used.
* **Options:** Modifiers that affect the search behavior, such as -name, -type, -size, etc.
* **Expression:** The search criteria, such as a filename, size, or modification time.

```bash
find . -name "file.txt" =   "file.txt" in the current directory and subdirectories.

find / -type f -size +1M =  files larger than 1MB in the entire file system.

find . -mtime -1 = find . -mtime -1: files modified in the last 24 hours in the current directory and subdirectories.
```

![[Pasted image 20240807161736.png]]

**ADVANCE  `options` FOR `find`**

```bash
-name: Search for files by name.
```

![[Pasted image 20240807161736.png]]

**USING `grep`** **COMMAND**
The grep command is a powerful search tool in **Linux** and Unix-like operating systems. It allows us to search for patterns within files or output of commands. The name **"grep"** comes from the phrase **"global regular expression print".**

**SYNOPSIS**
`grep options pattern file(s)`

- options are optional flags to modify the search behavior.
- pattern is the regular expression or string to search for.
- file(s) is the file(s) to search in.

**Examples**
```bash
- grep "hello" file.txt : Search for the string "hello" in file.txt

- grep -i "error" log.txt : Search for the string "error"in log.txt

- grep -r "pattern" directory/ : Search for the string "pattern" recursively in the directory and its subdirectories
```
![[Pasted image 20240807173643.png]]

`grep` can also be used with pipes (|) to search output of other commands:
```bash
ls -l | grep "file.txt" : Search for the string "file.txt" in the output of the ls -l command
```
![[Pasted image 20240807173801.png]]

```bash
-s : Silent mode (don't output error messages)
```
![[Pasted image 20240807175200.png]]

```bash
-o : Print only the matched parts of the lines
```
![[Pasted image 20240807175338.png]]


**USING `awk`** **COMMAND**
`awk` is a powerful tool for text processing, offering a wide range of features for:
* **Text filtering:** Select specific lines or fields based on conditions.
* **Text transformation:** Modify or format text, such as converting case or rearranging fields.
* **Text extraction:** Extract specific fields or data from text files.

**TERMS**
1. **Field separator:** The default field separator is whitespace
2. **Field numbering:** Fields are numbered starting from 1. $1 refers to the first field, $2 refers to the second field, and so on.
3. **Field access:** You can access fields using the $ symbol followed by the field number. For example, $1 prints the first field, $2 prints the second field, etc.
4. **Field manipulation:** You can perform operations on fields, such as printing, concatenating, or modifying them.

**FIELD EXPLANATION**
**A LINE**
![[Pasted image 20240808163534.png]]

**A FIELD**
![[Pasted image 20240808163638.png]]

**Examples**

**PRINT THE FIRST FIELD OF THE FIRST LINE**
```bash
awk 'NR==1 {print $1}' numbers =  print the first field of the first line
```

```
```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt = prints the first column (field) of each line in file.txt
```
![[Pasted image 20240808155355.png]]

```bash
awk '/AIVTIC/ {print $0}' file.txt = This prints entire lines from file.txt containing the string "AIVTIC"
```
![[Pasted image 20240808155514.png]]

```bash
awk '{print $1 "," $2 "," $3}' file.txt = This prints the first three fields of each line in file.txt, separated by commas.
```
![[Pasted image 20240808161212.png]]


**CONCATENATING**
```bash
awk '{print $1 $2}' - Concatenates the first and second fields without a separator.
```
![[Pasted image 20240808162124.png]]

```bash
awk '{print $1 "." $2}' - Concatenates the first and second fields with a period in between.
```
![[Pasted image 20240808162236.png]]

**MODIFYING**
```bash
awk '{ $1 = "AIVTIC"; print $0 }' - Replaces the first field with "AIVTIC" and prints the entire line.
```
![[Pasted image 20240808162810.png]]

```bash
awk '{ $2 = $2 + 10; print $0 }' - Increments the second field by 10 and prints the entire line.
```
![[Pasted image 20240808162916.png]]

awk '{gsub(/1/, "new_number", $1); print $0}' - Replaces "1" with "new_number" in the first field and prints the entire line.
```
![[Pasted image 20240808163811.png]]

```bash
awk '{print length($1)}' - Prints the length of the first field.
```
![[Pasted image 20240808163924.png]]

**CONDITIONAL STATEMENT**
```bash
awk '{if ($2 < 10) $2 = 10; print $0}' - Sets the second field to 10 if it's less than 10 and prints the entire line.
```

**COURSE:** LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM
**TOPIC:** SHELL SCRIPTING BASICS
**WEEK:** ONE
**INSTRUCTOR:** ZAKARIYYA DAHURU MUSA
****
Scripting is a form of programming where you write a series of commands or instructions to automate tasks on a computer. scripting is usually interpreted, meaning the script is read and executed directly by an interpreter.

**BENEFITS OF SCRIPTING**
* **Automate repetitive tasks:** Perform tasks without human intervention, saving time and reducing errors.
* **Simplify complex processes:** Break down intricate tasks into manageable, step-by-step instructions.
* **Increase productivity:** Focus on high-priority tasks while scripts handle routine or mundane work.
* **Improve accuracy:** Reduce human error by ensuring tasks are executed consistently and correctly.
* **Enhance flexibility:** Easily modify or update scripts as needs change, without affecting underlying systems.
* **Configuration management:** Scripts can be used to configure software environments, set up systems, and manage application deployment
- **System Admin:** System administrators use scripts to manage user accounts, monitor system health, automate updates, and handle other administrative tasks. This reduces the workload and ensures consistency across the systems they manage.

**SHELL SCRIPT**
A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell which could be one of the following:

- The Bourne Shell
- The C Shell
- The Korn Shell
- The GNU Bourne-Again Shell

A shell is a command-line interpreter and typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text. Shell scripts have several required constructs that tell the shell environment what to do and when to do it. Of course, most scripts are more complex than the above one.

The shell is, after all, a real programming language, complete with variables, control structures, and so forth. No matter how complicated a script gets, it is still just a list of commands executed sequentially.

 **Note** all the scripts would have the **.sh** extension

**CREATING A SIMPLE SCRIPT**
* Open a text editor CLI or GUI
* Declare your shebang  - `#!/bin/sh`
* Write your scripts and line of codes, save it
* Make it executable
* run it 


**EXECUTING A SCRIPT**
* Always use sudo to run scripts
* Make sure it has an executable permission
```bash
sudo bash ./simple_script.sh OR sudo ./simple_script.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Welcome to AIOVTI?"
read student
echo "Hello, $student"
```

`#!/bin/sh` This tells the system that the commands that follow are to be executed by the Bourne shell. it's called a shebang because the **#** symbol is called a hash, and the ! symbol is called a bang.

**COMMENTS**
A good script must have comments for readability, we use # to declare comments in scripting. A comment is not executed by the interpreter. It gives information about a line of code or the entire script.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Welcome message
echo "Welcome to AIOVTI?"

# Collect student name
read student

# Display student name with Hello
echo "Hello, $student"
```


**VARIABLES**
A variable is a container that allows us to store data from a user input or by declaring it. A variable name can have:
* Letters and numbers and underscore
* It cannot start with a number or special characters except  underscore

```c
VALID VARIABLES

_MUSA
AIOVTI_A
VAR_1
VAR_2

INVALID VARIABLES
2_MUSA
-VARIABLE
@MUSA
VAR_A!
```

**TYPES OF  VARIABLES**
* **Scalar variables:** Store a single value
* **Array variables:** Store multiple values
* **Integer variables:** Store whole numbers, e.g., age=30
* **String variables:** Store text values, e.g., name="John Doe"
* **Local variables:** Defined inside a function, only accessible within that function
* **Global variables:** Defined outside a function, accessible from anywhere in the script
* **Read-only variables:** Declared with read-only, cannot be modified

```bash
SCALAR VARIABLES
name="John Doe"

ARRAY VARAIBLES
colors=("red" "green" "blue")

INTEGAR VARIABLES
Age=20 

STRING VARIABLES
Batch="Batch C24

LOCAL VARIABLES
local greetings="Hello, World!"

GLOBAL VARIABLES
greetings="Hello, World!"

READONLY VARAIBLES
readonly PI=3.14
```

**SPECIAL VARIABLES**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Print the name of the script itself
echo "Script Name: $0"

# Print process ID of the script
echo "Process ID: $$"

# Print length of a parameter
param="Hello World"
echo "Length of parameter: ${#param}"

# Remove shortest prefix matching pattern
echo "${param#Hello }"

```

**ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS**
```c
+ (Addition)	Adds values on either side of the operator	

- (Subtraction)	Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand	

* (Multiplication)	Multiplies values on either side of the operator	

/ (Division)	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	

% (Modulus)	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder	

= (Assignment)	Assigns right operand in left operand	

== (Equality)	Compares two numbers, if both are same then returns true.

!= (Not Equality)
```

**RELATIONAL OPERATOR**
Bourne Shell supports the following relational operators that are specific to numeric values. These operators do not work for string values unless their value is numeric.

**CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS**
Conditional statements in bash are used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions or tests which is very useful in decision making.

**IF STATEMENT**
```bash
if condition; then
  # code to execute if condition is true
fi


if [ $x -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "x is greater than 10"
else
  echo "x is less than or equal to 10"
fi


if [ $x -gt 10 ] || [ $y -lt 20 ]; then
  echo "x is greater than 10 or y is less than 20"
fi
```

**IF-ELSE STATEMENT**
```bash
IF-ELSE STATEMENT
if condition; then
  # code to execute if condition is true
else
  # code to execute if condition is false
fi


if [ $x -gt 10 ] && [ $y -lt 20 ]; then
  echo "x is greater than 10 and y is less than 20"
else
  echo "x is not greater than 10 or y is not less than 20"
fi

```

**IF-ELIF-ELSE STATEMENT**

```c
IF-ELIF-ELSE STATEMENT
bash
if condition1; then
  # code to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2; then
  # code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
else
  # code to execute if both conditions are false
fi

if [ $x -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "x is greater than 10"
elif [ $x -eq 10 ]; then
  echo "x is equal to 10"
else
  echo "x is less than 10"
fi
```

**LOOPS**
Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met. 

**For loop:** 
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Print numbers from 1 to 5
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```


**BENEFITS OF LOOPING**
- Repeating tasks
- Iterating over data structures
- Implementing algorithms
- Simplifying code

**PRACTICAL EXERCISES**
* Write a script that uses variables and prints their values.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Declare and assign variables
name="John Doe"
age=30
city="New York"

# Print variable values
echo "Name: $name"
echo "Age: $age"
echo "City: $city"

# Declare and assign another variable
country="USA"

# Print the new variable value
echo "Country: $country"
```

* Create a script with a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Loop from 1 to 10
for i in {1..20}
do
  echo $i
done
```
* Write a script with an if-else statement that checks if a file exists.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the file to check
FILE="example.txt"

# Check if the file exists
if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
  echo "The file $FILE exists."
else
  echo "The file $FILE does not exist."
fi

```
